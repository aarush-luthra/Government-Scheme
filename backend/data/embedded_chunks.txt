Indian economy thrives through the means of enterprise creation as one of the 
prime movers of the economy. In this direction, “Make in India and Made in 
India” movement is integral to entrepreneurship development across the 
country. Therefore, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a 
vital role for strengthening the Indian economy.
MSMEs have been contributing to spreading entrepreneurial culture through 
business innovations. Unique feature of MSMEs is that they are widely 
dispersed across sectors of economy producing diverse range of products and 
services to meet local as well as global markets. Needless to mention that the 
contribution of MSME is 8 per cent of GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing 
output and 40 per cent of exports of the country and uniquely they are least

contribution of MSME is 8 per cent of GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing 
output and 40 per cent of exports of the country and uniquely they are least 
investment driven with high returns. Employment creation is next to 
agriculture, thus MSME sector has potential of tapping individuals to 
associate with economic activities by way of self-employemnt.
One of the priorities of our Government is the inclusive concept in enterprise 
creation. In this endeavour, this compilation would benefit all those 
entrepreneurs including first generation, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled 
castes, handicapped, ex-servicemen, marginalized communities, etc., for 
enabling them in creating enterprises.
Ministry of MSME has a number of schemes and programmes to help and 
assist entrepreneurs’ especially small businesses. Though ours is a dedicated 
Ministry for MSME, number of other Ministries in the Government of India 
has been supporting the cause. Leveraging information would enable

first generation entrepreneurs with lot of business ideas and thoughts who 
could derive full benefit in terms of minimizing their struggle to look for right

Various Ministries and Department of Government of India have been running 
Schemes targeted towards MSME Sector. It has been a good initiative by our 
Ministry to have collated this information into a single compilation. I 
congratulate NIMSME (National Institute for Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises) for this endeavour.
Information is power. Unfortunately people for whom certain types of 
information are disseminated are seldom able to locate such information. 
MSMEs are especially handicapped because such enterprises are run 
essentially by the entrepreneur along with one or two close associates. Thus, 
unlike a large enterprise which may have designated set of personnel to scout 
for available information continuously MSME entrepreneur do not have that 
luxury. On this count also this compilation would serve a very useful purpose.
In addition to entrepreneurs belonging to micro, small and medium sector,

In addition to entrepreneurs belonging to micro, small and medium sector, 
policy makers, academics and public at large may also find this compilation 
useful.

Quenching the thirst of entrepreneurs for enterprise operations is the focus of 
the Ministry of MSME. With this spirit behind, the ministry has been engaged 
in finding solutions to the issues related to enterprise promotion and 
development. Ministry of MSME creates policy framework for 
entrepreneurship development in the country. While its arms and extended 
field offices are engaged in translating these policies into reality on the ground, 
several other ministries of Government of India are also contributing towards 
this direction.
In this context, it is found relevant to compile these support services and 
schemes offered by various other ministries for proper dissemination and use 
by all concerned and especially those interested in venturing their own 
enterprises. To sum it up, this compilation is comprehensive information on 
enterprise development.
