Step 3:   Submit Undertaking and Original Bill for Reimbursement Upon the successful completion of the full course, the student must submit the original bill of the purchased instrument to the Tiatr Academy of Goa in order to claim the 50% subsidy on its cost.

Moreover, Dalit Bandhu Scheme in Telangana has several benefits for the SC community, including financial assistance, employment opportunities, and the promotion of entrepreneurship. The scheme has the potential to reduce economic disparities and promote inclusive growth in the state.",
    "eligibility": "**Here are the eligibility criteria for the scheme:**\n<br>\n\n\n1. _The scheme is applicable only to families belonging to the SC community._\n1. _The applicant must be a resident of Telangana._\n1. _The family should have an annual income of less than Rs. 2.5 lakh._\n1. _The family should not own more than 3 acres of agricultural land or more than one residential house._\n1. _The applicant should not have availed of any other government loan or subsidy._\n1. _The applicant should have a viable business plan or entrepreneurial idea that can be supported by the grant._\n1. _The applicant should be willing to contribute 10% of the project cost._\n1. _The applicant should have a bank account._\n1. _The applicant should have a digital identity, such as an Aadhaar card._\n1. _The applicant should be between the ages of 25 and 50._\n1. _The applicant should have passed at least the 10th standard._\n1. _The applicant should not have a criminal record or have been convicted of a crime._\n\n<br>\n\nThese eligibility criteria have been put in place to ensure that the scheme benefits those who are most in need of financial assistance to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures.

According to the Telangana Chief Minister, K.

It is worth noting that the scheme is not based on caste certificates, but on the socio-economic conditions of the families. Eligible Dalit families will receive financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs in a phased manner to start their own businesses or ventures.\n",
    "exclusions": "Although the Dalit Bandhu Scheme in Telangana aims to provide financial assistance to families belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community to help them become economically self-reliant, there are some exclusions to the scheme. Some of these exclusions are: Income criteria:  The scheme is applicable only to families with an annual income of less than Rs. 2.5 lakh. Families with higher incomes are not eligible for the scheme. Non-SC families:  The scheme is exclusively for families belonging to the SC community. Families from other castes and communities are not eligible for the scheme. Existing government loan or subsidy:  Families who have already availed of any other government loan or subsidy are not eligible for the scheme. Criminal record:  Families with a criminal record or who have been convicted of a crime are not eligible for the scheme. Land ownership:  Families who own more than three acres of agricultural land or more than one residential house are not eligible for the scheme. Educational qualifications:  Families with members who have completed a professional degree, such as engineering or medicine, are not eligible for the scheme. These exclusions have been put in place to ensure that the scheme benefits those who are most in need of financial assistance to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures. By limiting the scheme to eligible SC families who meet certain criteria, the government aims to ensure that the benefits of the scheme are targeted and reach the intended beneficiaries. Eligibility for the scheme is not based on caste certificates but on the socio-economic conditions of the families, which will be determined through a comprehensive survey. However, there is a possibility that some deserving families may be left out of the survey or may not meet the eligibility criteria. The scheme is limited to Telangana, which means that Dalit families in other states may not be able to benefit from it. The scheme provides financial assistance to start a business or venture, which may not be relevant for all beneficiaries. Overall, while the Dalit Bandhu scheme has the potential to benefit a significant number of Dalit families in Telangana, it is important to ensure that the implementation is transparent, inclusive, and non-discriminatory. Efforts should be made to identify and address any exclusionary factors and to provide support in areas beyond business and entrepreneurship.",
