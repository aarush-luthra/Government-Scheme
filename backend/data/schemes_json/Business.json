They may be bookbinding and notebooks manufacturing, chalk and crayon manufacture, jam, jelly, pickles manufacture, papad manufacture, saree, and embroidery work, printing and dyeing of clothes, and woolen weaving, amongst others.

    "level": "State/ UT",

        "mode": "Offline",
        "process": "For loans ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹3 lakh, applicants must be members of a cooperative society. If they wish to obtain a loan directly from a bank, they must become nominal members. The applicant must first obtain an application form from the bank or committee. The application form should include the applicant’s photograph, Aadhaar card, PAN card, work plan, annual income and expenditure details, and other relevant loan information. The applicant must also provide details of movable and immovable assets, such as land, deposits, etc. Two guarantors are required for the loan, and information about their movable and immovable assets must also be submitted. After submitting the application form along with land certificates, account records, and the Kisan Card to the relevant bank or committee, the block-level committee will select beneficiaries, cover them under the scheme, and sanction the loans accordingly. For loans up to ₹5 lakh, the group must submit a project report or proposal, as this loan is sanctioned to the group rather than to individual members. It is mandatory for the group to maintain an account with a cooperative bank. Self-help groups availing benefits under the scheme must be registered for activities covered by agriculture or agriculture-related schemes operated by the State or Central Government. The repayment period for a short-term loan of ₹1 lakh (crop loan) sanctioned under the scheme is one year from the date of disbursement. For a medium-term loan of ₹3 lakh, the repayment period is three years from the date of disbursement, and a project report is also required for such loans. The target for loan distribution under the scheme is determined based on the budget provisioned for each financial year. It is mandatory to obtain crop insurance for short-term agricultural loans sanctioned for crops notified under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The cooperative bank itself will arrange for the insurance of such agricultural loans. If a farmer does not receive a loan in a particular year but requires it in the following year, the department will consider his previously submitted application for processing in the next year. Process of Becoming a Member of the Cooperative Society: Interested applicants can apply for membership by filling out the prescribed membership application form available at the concerned society’s office and by depositing ₹108/- as the membership fee. The Board of Directors reviews the membership application through the relevant committee and either accepts or rejects it. To become a member, the applicant must provide a land ownership certificate for the area, a certificate from the Patwari confirming agricultural activity, and an Aadhaar card."

    "exclusions": "Although the Dalit Bandhu Scheme in Telangana aims to provide financial assistance to families belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community to help them become economically self-reliant, there are some exclusions to the scheme. Some of these exclusions are: Income criteria:  The scheme is applicable only to families with an annual income of less than Rs. 2.5 lakh. Families with higher incomes are not eligible for the scheme. Non-SC families:  The scheme is exclusively for families belonging to the SC community. Families from other castes and communities are not eligible for the scheme. Existing government loan or subsidy:  Families who have already availed of any other government loan or subsidy are not eligible for the scheme. Criminal record:  Families with a criminal record or who have been convicted of a crime are not eligible for the scheme. Land ownership:  Families who own more than three acres of agricultural land or more than one residential house are not eligible for the scheme. Educational qualifications:  Families with members who have completed a professional degree, such as engineering or medicine, are not eligible for the scheme. These exclusions have been put in place to ensure that the scheme benefits those who are most in need of financial assistance to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures. By limiting the scheme to eligible SC families who meet certain criteria, the government aims to ensure that the benefits of the scheme are targeted and reach the intended beneficiaries. Eligibility for the scheme is not based on caste certificates but on the socio-economic conditions of the families, which will be determined through a comprehensive survey. However, there is a possibility that some deserving families may be left out of the survey or may not meet the eligibility criteria. The scheme is limited to Telangana, which means that Dalit families in other states may not be able to benefit from it. The scheme provides financial assistance to start a business or venture, which may not be relevant for all beneficiaries. Overall, while the Dalit Bandhu scheme has the potential to benefit a significant number of Dalit families in Telangana, it is important to ensure that the implementation is transparent, inclusive, and non-discriminatory. Efforts should be made to identify and address any exclusionary factors and to provide support in areas beyond business and entrepreneurship.",
    "application process": [
      {
        "mode": "Offline",
        "process": "The application process for the Dalit Bandhu scheme in Telangana is as follows: Eligible applicants can obtain the application form from the website of the Telangana State Scheduled Castes Development Corporation (TSSCDC). The application form must be duly filled in and submitted along with the required documents to the TSSCDC office in the applicant's district. The required documents include proof of identity, proof of residence, proof of age, proof of income, proof of educational qualifications, a viable business plan or entrepreneurial idea, and a bank account number. Once the application is received and verified, the TSSCDC will conduct a feasibility study of the proposed business or entrepreneurial venture. The TSSCDC will then approve the grant and disburse the funds directly to the applicant's bank account. The applicant will be required to contribute 10% of the project cost, and the grant will cover the remaining 90%. The applicant will also be required to undergo training in financial management, entrepreneurship, and other relevant skills. The applicant will be required to submit regular progress reports to the TSSCDC, and the performance of the business or entrepreneurial venture will be monitored. The application process for the Dalit Bandhu scheme is designed to be transparent and efficient, with a focus on ensuring that the benefits of the scheme reach the intended beneficiaries. By providing financial assistance and support to eligible SC families to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, the government aims to reduce economic disparities and promote inclusive growth in the state. Based on the information available so far, it is likely that the application process will also involve the following steps: Eligible Dalit families will be identified through a comprehensive survey of their socio-economic conditions. The Telangana Dalit Bandhu Corporation, which is the implementing agency for the scheme, will notify the eligible families and provide them with information on the application process. The eligible families will be required to submit an application, which will include details of their proposed business or venture, as well as any other relevant information. The applications will be reviewed and processed by the Corporation, which will provide financial assistance in a phased manner to the approved beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will also receive capacity-building and training programs, as well as support for marketing and access to credit. It is important to note that the exact details of the application process will be communicated by TSSCDC, and the application process may be subject to change.

The relevant line departments subsequently submit their initial approval or disagreement on the project online to the Industries Department, along with the reasons for their decision. Proposals for non-MSME projects (investments exceeding ₹50 crore or as amended from time to time) are submitted through the Single Window Portal to the Nodal Officer at the Directorate of Industries.
