For the Annual Scholarship, request the K1 form, which is printed on light green paper. For the One-Time Grant, request the K2 form, which is printed on light blue paper. If you have previously received a K1 and are still below 18 years and fulfilling other conditions (renewal), get in touch with your Head of Institution (HOI), who will verify your unmarried status and age and process your renewal. If you have received K1 and have crossed 18 years (up-gradation), collect a pre-printed K2 Up-gradation form from the institution, fill it up, and submit it. Do not fill up the colored K2 form if you have already received K1, as you will be treated as a duplicate applicant. Step 2:   Open a bank account in your name : You must have a bank account in your name when applying for the Scheme. This is because Kanyashree's benefits will be sent by the government DIRECTLY to your bank account. If you do not have a bank account, ask your institution's head teacher to assist you in opening one. Please ensure the spelling of your name do not differ in the bank account and that of the application form. Step 3:   Fill up the application form : You or your parents need to fill up all the details in the form. Again, your teachers and head teacher may be approached to help if you are not sure what to do. Your form needs to be signed by several people – check page 3 of the application form. Caution: Check the spelling of your name that you are going to enter in the application form. It must be the same as that of your bank account. Please enter your mobile number correctly because you will get updates regarding the status of your application on your mobile number entered in the form. Put your signature on pages 1,2, and 3 of the form. Preserve the acknowledgement form for further tracking of your application. Step 4:   Provide Necessary Documents: Submit photocopies of the required documents (refer to the \"DOCUMENTS REQUIRED\" section). Step 5:   Collect Acknowledgement Receipt: The Kanyashree application form has a tear-off section on Page 3 titled \"Acknowledgement as per WBRTPS Act 2013.\" When the completed application form is submitted to the Head Teacher, they will fill in the details, sign it, apply an official stamp, tear off that portion, and hand it over to the applicant. Keep this acknowledgement slip carefully as it contains the Form No., name, and other details, serving as proof of application for Kanyashree. Track Your Application:  Once the complete application with all supporting documents is handed over to the institution, the application is uploaded onto the  Kanyashree Portal . Applicants can track their application status on the portal using their Form No. (found on the Acknowledgement Slip). If the applicant changes institutions after receiving the annual scholarship, the previous Head of Institution must transfer the Kanyashree record online to the new institution to enable processing of further applications."

Under this scheme, a take-home ration (7.5kgs nutritious) is provided every month to Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers, and Sabla (Adolescent Category girls in the age group of 11-14 years). \n       The nutritional status of women and children in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is alarming.

Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers.\n             As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving ₹1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back.

        "mode": "Offline",
        "process": "Step 1:   Identification and Registration of Beneficiary An Accredited Social Health Activist, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Anganwadi Worker, or any designated link worker will identify and register the pregnant woman as a beneficiary of the scheme. This crucial step should be completed at least 20 to 24 weeks before the expected date of delivery to ensure timely access to benefits and services. Step 2:   Maternal and Child Health Card Filling Immediately upon successful registration, the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Accredited Social Health Activist, Anganwadi Worker, or an equivalent link worker will accurately complete a Maternal and Child Health card. This card is issued in duplicate, with one copy provided to the mother and the other retained by the link worker, forming an essential part of the Janani Suraksha Yojana registration. Step 3:   Antenatal Care Information and Planning The designated link worker will inform the applicant about the schedule for at least three antenatal care check-ups and the required Tetanus Toxoid injections, ensuring these services are provided. Furthermore, they will clearly identify and communicate the health center for all necessary referrals and the predetermined place of delivery, along with the expected date of delivery. The Accredited Social Health Activist is responsible for following up on antenatal care visits at Anganwadi Centres or Sub-centers to ensure the beneficiary's attendance. Step 4:   Collection of Necessary Proofs/Certificates If required by the specific eligibility criteria, the Accredited Social Health Activist, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Anganwadi Worker, or a link worker will assist the applicant in collecting the necessary Below Poverty Line or other relevant proofs and certificates from the local Panchayat, local bodies, or Municipalities. This step should be completed within two to four weeks from the initial registration date. Step 5:   Submission for Verification and Fund Arrangement The completed Janani Suraksha Yojana card is to be submitted to the Medical Officer of the Primary Health Centre for verification. Concurrently, proactive steps are undertaken to arrange transport or ensure the availability of cash for the beneficiary to reach the health center for delivery or in case of complications. It is also ensured that adequate funds are available with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, health worker, or Accredited Social Health Activist for the prompt disbursement of benefits. General Steps for Receiving the Benefits Step 1:   Accessing Health Centre for Delivery The pregnant woman, ideally accompanied by an Accredited Social Health Activist or another designated link worker, will proceed to the pre-determined government or accredited private health institution for delivery. The Accredited Social Health Activist is expected to stay with the woman until her discharge from the facility. Step 2:   Cash Benefit Disbursement at Institution Upon arrival and registration for delivery at the health center, the mother and, if applicable, the Accredited Social Health Activist, should receive their entitled cash benefit immediately. The Auxiliary Nurse Midwife or Accredited Social Health Activist (or another identified link worker operating under the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife's guidance) will typically manage this disbursement process. For deliveries occurring in accredited private institutions, the cash benefit is disbursed to the mother via the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife/Accredited Social Health Activist/link worker channel. In some hospital settings, a voucher scheme may be implemented, where an admission slip for delivery, combined with a voucher for the mother’s package and transport assistance, is provided for encashment at the hospital’s cash counter upon discharge. All payments before or after seven days of delivery are treated as illegitimate subject to audit objection. Step 3:   Postnatal Care and Immunization The Accredited Social Health Activist is mandated to conduct a postnatal visit within seven days following delivery to monitor the mother's health and to facilitate the newborn's immunization, specifically for Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). This postnatal visit and the child's immunization are prerequisites for the Accredited Social Health Activist to receive her second payment installment. Step 4:   Sterilization Compensation (if applicable) Should the mother or her husband voluntarily choose to undergo sterilization immediately after the child's delivery, the compensation money designated under the existing Family Welfare scheme will be disbursed directly to the mother at the hospital premises. Application Deadlines Timely registration for antenatal care, ideally 20-24 weeks before the expected date of delivery. Additionally, cash benefits for home delivery should be disbursed at the time of delivery or approximately 7 days prior. Payments made outside of a seven-day window around delivery are subject to audit objections. Where to Apply Registration for the scheme and access to services are facilitated through government health centers, including Sub-centers, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, First Referral Units, and District and State Hospitals. Services may also be availed at accredited private institutions. Key contact points at the community level for guidance and assistance are Accredited Social Health Activists, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, and Anganwadi Workers. Application Status Tracking To ensure transparency and allow beneficiaries to track their status, a list of Janani Suraksha Yojana beneficiaries, detailing the date of cash disbursement, must be prominently displayed on notice boards at all Sub-centers, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, and District Hospitals. This list is required to be updated regularly on a monthly basis. Help & Support / Grievance Redressal Each district is mandated to establish a dedicated grievance redressal cell under the District Project Management Unit. This cell serves to address and resolve complaints concerning eligibility for the scheme, the accurate quantum of cash assistance, and any delays encountered in the disbursement of cash benefits. Crucially, comprehensive information about this grievance cell, including the officer's name, postal address, and telephone number, must be prominently displayed at all health centers and institutions to ensure easy access for beneficiaries."
