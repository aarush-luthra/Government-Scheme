    "question": "give me some schemes",
    "answer": "Hello Sample Kumar! I'm here to help you find government schemes that you may be eligible for. Based on your profile, here are the schemes that match your criteria:\n\n### 1. **Top Class Education For Scheduled Caste Students**\n- **Why You're Eligible**: You belong to the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, and your annual family income of Rs. 6,000 is below the prescribed limit of ₹ 8 Lakh per annum.\n- **Key Benefits**: This scheme provides financial assistance for students pursuing studies beyond class 12th in notified institutions.\n- **How to Apply**: You would need to check the specific application process for the notified institutions.\n\n### 2. **Feed The Seed**\n- **Why You're Eligible**: As a farmer, you are eligible for seed production under this scheme, which supports farmers with livestock farming.\n- **Key Benefits**: The scheme aims to provide livestock seeds to farmers to enhance agricultural productivity.\n- **How to Apply**: You would need to check with local agricultural departments for the application process.\n\n### 3. **National Agriculture Insurance Scheme**\n- **Why You're Eligible**: As a farmer, you can apply for insurance coverage voluntarily under this scheme.\n- **Key Benefits**: This scheme provides financial protection against crop loss due to various risks.\n- **How to Apply**: You must submit your application before the deadline for each crop season.\n\nUnfortunately, other schemes such as the Post Matric Students of Class 11th & 12th (Scheduled Caste) and the Scheduled Caste Boys/Girls Housing Assistance Scheme do not match your profile since you are not currently enrolled in school or college at that level, and the housing assistance scheme is specific to Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
